# vdxrancid
This is a slightly updated version of VDXrancid, forked from buraglio/vdxrancid and incorporating a few udates, fixes, and cleanups.
My goal is to get this cleaned up and submitted back into mainline rancid.
This code is copyleft per the standard rancid license terms.

Please note that this is a work in progress, and is not intended for long-term support.  If you're using this code from this source, you're doing so at your own risk (it works for me, but is likely to become outdated quickly, and it hasn't been widely tested.  But if you do use it, I'd appreciate feedback.
